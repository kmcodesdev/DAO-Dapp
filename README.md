Illuviun is an App that showcase the function and technology required to create & sustain a Decentralized autonomous organization.

By developing this Dapp around the framework provided by Buildspace x thirdweb i managed to:

âœ…Â deploy my own custom ERC-20 token

âœ…Â deploy my own ERC-1155 NFT people can mint to join Illuniun DAO.

âœ…Â deploy my own governance contract + treasury.


âœ…Â build a dapp that lets people connect their wallet, get an NFT, see a DAO Dashboard where they can see other members + actually vote on proposals that are executed directly by Illuviun governance contract.

. The app is currently available [here](https://illuniun.vercel.app/) only on Ethereum Rinkeby Testnet
